## Front-End Architecture

The front-end of this application leverages React.js & react-bootstrap. Please find all relevant documentation 
listed below.

The front-end is located in the sprint-4 subdirectory. The `sprint-4/public` folder houses all the required static html/css files. As a developer working on new features, you should not need to access this.

The `sprint-4/src` folder is where the bulk of front-end development occurs. `sprint-4/src/App.js` is where the main front-end application is rendered out. `sprint-4/src/pages` is where react components are stored, which are then called in `App.js`. **All front-end code is well commented, and reviewing these comments will grant a developer a better understanding of the structure and logic of the front-end application.**
